# @ng-stack

This Angular library contains several projects:
- [@ng-stack/forms](./projects/forms) - provides wrapped Angular's Reactive Forms to write its more strongly typed.
- [@ng-stack/contenteditable](./projects/contenteditable) - a micro Angular v4+ contenteditable directive for integration with Angular forms. It just implements [ControlValueAccessor](https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor) for this purpose.
- [@ng-stack/api-mock](./projects/api-mock) - this is an alternative of [angular-in-memory-web-api](https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api).
